        We are focusing mainly on product development & support, custom software and outsourcing services.Given our
        strong commitment to continuous improvement, we have evolved steadily both in terms of technology and
        methodology. On the technology side, Integrisoft is proud to have delivered complex solutions using the most
        advanced technologies, our current focus being on web and mobile applications. As a consequence of the strong
        direction of using best practices in software development and management, we have been ISO 9001 - 2001 certified
        since 2008 by TUV Thuringen, ISO 27001
      </p>
      <p>
        Our dedication to excellence and customer satisfaction promoted our products and services as market leaders in
        the
        segments we are addressing (ERP solutions for SME, integrated solutions for local government). We are currently
        the number one provider of local tax software solutions for local government in Romania. Since this is a highly
        demanding domain, having high performance requirements and allowing very few errors, we consider we have passed
        a
        difficult market test, so we are ready to take on new challenges.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of our most important strategic directions is investing in people. Corroborated with the sustained success
        of
        the last several years, our team has doubled over the last 3 years, despite the harsh economic conditions. Our
        staff brings to the table a tremendous amount of knowledge and expertise, as well as international and
        interdisciplinary experience.
