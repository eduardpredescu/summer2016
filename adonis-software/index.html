      <p>We are a team of young professionals from Bucharest, Romania. Our team is formed of creative designers and expert developers with great experience in programming, especially in smartphone application development. We believe that each one of us is a unique and creative force for the company.</p>
      <p>New technologies make our eyes spark, so we like to play with beacons, leap motion, AR, VR, Unity (gaming) and what not. We are among the first to build projects with new technologies and we are proud of that... although working with betas and new technologies sometimes is a big headache.</p>
      <blockquote class="leading-large">
        <p>Great team. Very professional, knowledgeable and experienced. Easy to communicate and work with. Strongly recommended and would love to do business with you again. Thank you Ancu, Lucian, Vlad and the rest of the team. You guys rock!</p>
